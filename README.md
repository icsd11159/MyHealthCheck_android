Title:                                                    "MyHealthCheck"
Programming Language: MySql,php,html,css, server
Software: Android Studio and Rapid Miner with RapidMiner,phpMyAdmin
Two side project:
1)A Web Application for doctor , where he can sign new patients and search,add,delete or edit their microbiological examinations after insert them into MySqlDatabase . Furthermore he can just upload the pdf of the examination's result , and rapid miner make all the work for him .Detailed, I trained a process wich take the uploaded file , through rapidminerServer , with only a user's click to a link ,
 so the iatrical parameter being extract to their results and insert them with the connected 'myhealthcheck' database .
2)An Android App for patient , who -after sign in - he can see his examination's results and also he can open the microbiological pdf .Furthermore,he can add a 'SOS' number  , and with a click of a 'SOS' button send ,via SMS, the exact location ,with the coordinates , to the chosen person with details of  where this patient is in emergency situation. Also , there is an option , where they can see his exact location in google map and find the nearby hospitals and pharmacies , marked on his map.
It is not ready for presentation , so there are not many descriptions into my code.
